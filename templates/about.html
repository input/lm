      <h2>Python and Django</h2>
      <p>I have a comprehensive knowledge of Python and Django—a leading, open-source Python-based web framework.</p>
      <p>On the backend, my day-to-day work includes Python programming, (Linux) server and database administration, and Django project building (coding models, views, etc.).
      Meanwhile, on the frontend, my day-to-day work predominantly comprises Django website/app building and theming, using technologies including the Django Template Language (DTL), JavaScript/TypeScript, and CSS.</p>
      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>I provide development services for clients across the world, most often working remotely from London, UK. Previous clients have been located in the UK, Australia, Belgium, and the US.</p>
      <p>For all work enquiries, quote requests, etc. please <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">contact me</a> (preferably via email) and provide as much information as possible.</p>
      <h2>Drupal</h2>
      <p>I worked with Drupal from version 4.6 (you can find me on drupal.org as <a href="http://drupal.org/user/96416" target="_blank">laurencemercer</a>) and built and themed many Drupal-based sites, including michaeljackson.com and jimihendrix.com.</p>
